# 🌐 Physics with Three.js and Rapier 🚀

Welcome to my repository where I've integrated physics into Three.js using Rapier! 🎮
Physics engines add dynamic and fun interaction to games and realtime animations. Rapier is a fast, stable physics engine built with Rust. It works well with JavaScript and Three.js.

## 📖 About

This project is all about bringing physics to life in the 3D web graphics world using Three.js and Rapier. It's a demonstration of how physics can be simulated in a web browser with a bit of creativity and technical knowledge. 🎨💻

## 🛠️ Built With

This project is built with Three.js, a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics on a Web browser, and Rapier.js, a high-performance physics engine that can handle rigid bodies and deformable bodies in both 2D and 3D.

## 🌟 Features

- Realistic physics simulations in a 3D environment 🌐
- Detailed textures and lighting for a more realistic look 💡
- User interaction: The physics objects respond to user input 🕹️

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open index.html in your browser to see the physics simulation in action!
